## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contributing Process
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Adding a New Sample App
When adding a new sample app:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Include a detailed README.md in your app directory
3. Add proper documentation and setup instructions
4. Include any necessary configuration files
5. Update the main README.md to list your app
